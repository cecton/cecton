## About This Profile

I'm no longer participating in open source as a maintainer or contributor.

For a long time, I was deeply involved in open source — building things, collaborating, contributing where I could. It started with genuine curiosity and joy. But over time, the pressure, expectations, and unspoken obligations took a toll. Interactions that should have been creative or constructive often turned adversarial, political, or simply exhausting.

I've been hurt both by contributors and by maintainers. I’ve also made mistakes myself. I don't see this as a story of good vs bad actors — just a system that doesn’t protect the people in it. A culture that encourages visibility and perfection, but rarely offers safety, rest, or space to be imperfect.

I’m stepping away to reclaim the reason I started programming in the first place: because it was fun, strange, and full of possibility. Because I liked building things no one asked for. Because I liked following ideas off the edge of the map, even if they went nowhere. That’s what I want now — space to explore again, without the weight of audience or approval.

You may still see projects appear here from time to time. When I build something that I think might be useful or interesting, I may publish it. But:

- **I don’t accept contributions, bug reports, or questions**
- **These projects are not community-managed or supported**
- **You are welcome to fork and build your own version — no permission needed**

I don’t believe in “hostile forks.” I believe forking is how ideas grow. If you see something here and want to take it somewhere else, do it. You don’t need consensus or a vote or approval from the original author. Open source should be evolutionary, chaotic, and plural — not an endless debate over who owns what.

We need more weird ideas. More one-person projects. More tools built for joy, not traction. Open source doesn’t need to be professionalized or standardized to be valuable. There’s no single right way — just many paths. I’m choosing mine.

I’m coding again — but privately, anonymously, and without the emotional exposure of public maintenance. I hope you’re building what feels right to *you*, too.
