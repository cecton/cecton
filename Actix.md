## Chaos, Ownership, and the Actix Problem: A Personal Take on Open Source

The Actix situation has stayed with me for a long time — not just because of what happened to its author, but because of what it reveals about the cultural fault lines in open source.

In short: the author of Actix was harshly criticized, personally attacked, and publicly cornered over their use of `unsafe` code and perceived resistance to community feedback. It eventually pushed them to quit. While the details of that situation are specific, the underlying story isn’t rare.

I believe what happened with Actix was wrong — not because people had technical disagreements, but because those disagreements escalated into abuse. And once you start treating a person like a public utility, not a human, something breaks.

The core issue wasn’t the code. It was ownership.

### Personal Projects Are Not Public Property

When someone releases open source code, it’s an invitation to use, not an obligation to serve. It doesn’t automatically entitle anyone to a voice in how that code evolves — especially not through pressure, guilt, or intimidation. And it definitely doesn’t entitle anyone to interrogate, question, or harass the author over their decisions.

Open source is not a social contract where maintainers promise to behave like customer service agents, product managers, or full-time educators. Sometimes people just want to share what they built — nothing more.

The tragedy of Actix is that the community treated a creative space like a public negotiation table. The problem wasn’t disagreement; it was the assumption that disagreement should result in control.

### Forks Are Freedom

What should have happened — and what should *always* happen — is simple: **fork it**.

Forks aren’t failures. They’re freedom. They’re the built-in release valve for creative divergence. If you think a project is going in the wrong direction, you can fork it and prove your point. That’s the beauty of open source — nobody has to "win" the argument. You just build your own future.

Calling forks "hostile" or "divisive" misunderstands their role. A fork is not a betrayal. It’s just a declaration that different visions can co-exist. And if you’re right — if your fork solves a real problem better — it will speak for itself. If not, no harm done.

The healthiest ecosystems are full of forks. Full of experiments. Full of contradictory ideas. Evolution isn’t tidy, and progress doesn’t come from consensus —
